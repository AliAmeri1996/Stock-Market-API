*Week 1
-This week I was focused on choosing a project that I'd be working on and after some research and considering
my internship on summer, ive chosen to learn about FAST API and create a stock market API. My plan's to 
do a Udemy course about FAST APIs, learn the basics and then build the stock market project. I dont know much
about APIs but over the next 6 weeks, ill immerse myself into it.


*Week 2
Ive decided to create a voice to text recogmition website using FAST API instead of the stock market webiste. The reason to do this is becuse this task is more challenging which helps me learn more things. Apart from that, I'm doing this in collaboration with a friend of mine. The front of the the webstie would be Typescript. My plant is to first learn as much as possible about Fast API and then start the project.
