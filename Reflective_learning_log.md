*First week
-This week I was focused on choosing a project that I'd be working on and after some research and considering
my internship on summer, ive chosen to learn about FAST API and create a stock market API. My plan's to 
do a Udemy course about FAST APIs, learn the basics and then build the stock market project. I dont know much
about APIs but over the next 6 weeks, ill immerse myself into it.
